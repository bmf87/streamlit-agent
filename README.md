## ReAct Agents - reasoning and acting interwoven

* Agents are not just chatbots. They can do more than generate information.
* Agents act/interact with websites, other software, and services to acheive their goals.
* Agents can act on your behalf and integrate into and enhance your life through interactive assistance with:
  * Scheduling meetings
  * Shopping
  * Booking travel  
* Agents can even work with other agents to execute complex workflows.
